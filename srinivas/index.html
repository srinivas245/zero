            of freshly extracted oil. And the greatest taste can be experienced in the first few weeks. But nowadays, all we are buying are bland, rancid smelling old
            stock pickles.</p>
          <p>Andhraiites became CEO's of some of the World's largest companies, but we have no proper authentic pickle company yet. We are filling that gap.</p>
